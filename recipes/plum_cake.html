    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, softened </li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups plums, pitted and quartered</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch tube pan.</li>
        <li>Separate eggs into whites and yolks. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Stir flour and baking powder together, then blend into butter mixture. Gently fold in egg whites. Spread cake batter evenly into the prepared pan. There will only be a little over an inch of batter. Arrange plums, skin-side down, in a nice pattern over the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool before serving.</li>
    </ol>
